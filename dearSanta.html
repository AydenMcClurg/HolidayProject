                    <p class="">For this year we have all come together as nice boys to ask you for a whole list of things we want 
                        this year. Except for Isaiah and Adrian, We would like to own our own PS5. Since they are sold out all over America, we thought
                        we would ask you for one because you would never run out of stock. Instead, Isaiah would like to have an Origin PC, and a GEFORCE RTX 3090 for his computer.
                        This is something he really wants, so he would really appreciate it if you were able to make his dreams come true this Christmas.
                        Jimmy this year was the goodest of boys, and therefore, he wants to have his very own Bose Smart Soundbar 300 to have in his room.
                        This year, Adrian wants his very own Autrix Magic Star Cube, so that he can spend some free time playing with it on the bus.
                        Along with that, he also wants a Raspberry Pi 4 so he can expand his technological horizons. 
                        This Christmas, Kevin wants a Game Capture Card to record awesome YouTube Content for his amazing Channel named "KoreanPepsi", He also wants 1,000,000
                        subscribers this Christmas. Ayden wants RGB lights to be able to decorate his room and make it more epic. Thank you for your time and consideration of our awesome gifts.
                        This would make our year so much better.
